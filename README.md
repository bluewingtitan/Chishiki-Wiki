> Lightweight Ingame-Wiki Solution for Unity3D

[Download the current Package](https://github.com/bluewingtitan/ChishikiWiki-Releases/releases/)


### Easily Create and Edit Ingame-Wikis Right Inside Unity.

## Features
* Easy to understand Custom Editor without unnecessary clutter.
* The Engine is the limit: Simple Interface for Content-Automation, as powerful as your Scripts are.
* Everyone does what they are best at: You create the UI, Chishiki does the Wiki.
* Free for everyone.

The Asset store might follow soon, but I need to setup a website with example projects for Unity to accept the package.

Warning: The Documentation contained in the Package is deprecated. I am working on a YouTube Series right now and on writing good docs using a GitHub-Wiki.

Speaking of free: If Chishiki helped you out, [buy the developer a cup of coffee](https://www.paypal.com/donate?hosted_button_id=7EJBCZQZNQ3BL) :D
